# odin-sql_zoo

Completed as part of The Odin Project.

Not the easiest to follow course in the world! I only discovered the extra sections (window lag especially) right at the end, when looking through other student submissions in TOP. Then I checked the 'Save Progress' screen and - whole new sections to complete!

I can see why these were hidden away, as they were less structured than the other sections and without supporting quizzes etc.

Still great content, and I am really glad I did get a look at RANK and PARTITION as that was really interesting.

In my implementation I have used my own somewhat idiosyncratic formatting for SQL:
- River for main keywords, most important keywords left of the river (e.g. AND goes on right of the river)
- Line up multiple columns lightly indented when needed
- Brackets lined up vertically opening and closing when needed
- For joins, put the join on the same line if possible and line up conditions in a sensible way.

It is not 'correct' or going to pass any linting, but it is what makes sense to me. Occasionally I have added comments to myself especially for the most difficult tasks.
